As your web application grows bigger it's easy to lose control of its CSS code. This application helps you regain control by going through your code files and showing you the location of style attributes, style tags, repeated colors, and unused CSS classes.

### Features & Usage:

Usage: ./csscheck [-h] [--unused [-r] HTMLPATH [-r] CSSPATH] [--style_tags [-r] HTMLPATH] [--style_atts [-r] HTMLPATH] [--colors [-r] CSSPATH]

--help -h	Show this screen.
--unused	Show paths of CSS files that contain unused classes, along with the names of those classes.
--style_tags	Show paths of HTML and PHP files in which the style tag is used.
--style_atts	Show paths of HTML and PHP files in which the 'style' attribute is used, along with a count of the elements that contain the attribute in each file.
--colors	Show paths of CSS files that contain repeated colors, along with the names of those colors and their occurence frequency.
-r		Search recursively.

#### Implemented:

**Show "style" attributes:** It's bad practice to mix CSS code with HTML code. This option shows you all HTML and PHP files where the "style" attribute is used, along with a list of the elements in which it's used.
```
./csscheck --styleatts [-r] [/PATH/TO/HTML/OR/PHP/FILE/OR/FOLDER]
```
**Show <style> tags:** Using style tags isn't as problematic as using style attributes, but you still need at least to keep track of CSS code defined that way. This option shows you all HTML and PHP files in which the style tag is used.
```
./csscheck --styletags [-r] [/PATH/TO/HTML/OR/PHP/FILE/OR/FOLDER]
```
#### WIP:

**Show repeated colors:** CSS colors which are repeatedly used should be placed inside variables. This option shows you repeated colors and their occurence frequency. There's support for the keywords, hexadecimal, and RGBA color models.

**Show unused classes:** A common problem is that classes defined in CSS files sometimes end up being unused in HTML/PHP files. This option shows you the paths of CSS files that contain unused classes, along with the names of those classes.

### Compatibility:

This application is being developed on Linux, but every effort is being made to make it work on all major UNIX-like systems (Linux, *BSD, and macOS).

A Windows port is in my long-term plans for the application.

### License:

This application is released under the MIT license. To keep it that way, all static libraries used, or will be used, will be ones with permissive licenses.

### Notes:

_There's a prototype for this application which I wrote in Python and published in another repository.

_Don't forget to put paths in double quotes if they contains spaces.
